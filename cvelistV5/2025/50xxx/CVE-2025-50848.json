CS Cart 4.18.3 allows unrestricted upload of HTML files, which are rendered directly in the browser when accessed. This allows an attacker to upload a crafted HTML file containing malicious content, such as a fake login form for credential harvesting or scripts for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Since the content is served from a trusted domain, it significantly increases the likelihood of successful phishing or script execution against other users."
